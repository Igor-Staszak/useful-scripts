## Getting the URLs for checking

In order to check the websites you need to prepare a URLs.

### gdziepolek.pl

Go to the website, insert your location, medicine name and get the URL from the location bar.

### ktomalek.pl

Go to the website, insert your location, medicine name, copy the URL by pressing the button `UdostÄ™pnij wyszukiwanie`.

## Usage

1. Provide the URLs as the function parameters:
   ```bash
   check_ktomalek("url1")
   check_gdziepolek("url2")
   ```
2. Optionally, place the script in the crontab so it checks every X minutes.

## Potential improvements

In the future, the script can be easily improved by for example adding a push notification (via email, discord message, etc.).
